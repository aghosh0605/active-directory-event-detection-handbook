  * Right-click on a folder (e.g., `C:\SharedFolder`) > **Properties**.
  * Go to the **Sharing** tab > Click **Advanced Sharing** > Check **Share this folder**.
  * Optionally, set permissions by clicking **Permissions** and assigning read/write access.
* **Access the Shared Folder**:
  *   On another machine or the same machine, press `Win + R`, type:

      ```batch
      \\<hostname>\SharedFolder
      ```

      Replace `<hostname>` with the machineâ€™s name or IP address and `SharedFolder` with the shared folder's name.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="CMD" %}
* Log in to a Windows system with access to shared resources.
* Access a shared folder or file using the UNC path (e.g., `\\<server_name>\<share_name>`).
*   Alternatively, map the shared drive using the following command in Command Prompt:

    ```batch
    net use Z: \\<server_name>\<share_name>
    ```
* Replace `<server_name>` with the hostname or IP of the file server and `<share_name>` with the name of the shared folder.
* Interact with the files within the share (e.g., open, copy, or edit).
*   Disconnect the mapped drive with:

    ```batch
    net use Z: /delete
    ```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Powershell" %}
When the shared folder is ready we can access it like below:

```batch
copy \\servername\sharefolder\somefile .
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
